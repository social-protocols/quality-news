<h2 id="upvote-rate">Upvote Rate</h2>
<p>The <strong class="upvoterate">Ã—upvoteRate</strong> quantifies how much more or less
likely users are to upvote this story compared to the average story. It
is calculated as the story's total upvotes divided by total
<strong>expected upvotes</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="expected-upvotes">Expected Upvotes</h2>
<p>The <strong>expected upvotes</strong> for a story is an estimate of
the number of upvotes the <strong>average story</strong> would have
received if it were shown at the same times at the same ranks.</p>

<h2 id="raw-rank">Raw Rank</h2>
<p>The <strong>raw rank</strong> is the rank that a story would have
according to the "raw" Hacker News ranking formula:</p>
<pre><code>upvotes^0.8 / (ageHours+2)^1.8</code></pre>

<p>This formula produces a certain ranking that you can see on the (<a href="https://news.social-protocols.org/raw">raw page</a>).

But the HN ranking is further influenced by moderator actions, user flags, and other factors which boost or penalize stories.

</p>


<h2 id="rank-delta">Rank Delta</h2>
<p>The delta between the raw rank and front page rank. An <span class="over-ranked">over-ranked</span> page may have received a boost by HN moderators, while an
<span class="under-ranked">under-ranked</span> page may have received a penalty.
</p>




{{/*
<h2 id="rank-delta">Rank Delta</h2>
<p>The <strong>rank delta</strong> is the difference between the story's
actual rank and it's <strong>raw rank</strong> (described above).</p>

<p>
A value of +1 means that a story is ranked 1 position higher on the front page than if it were ranked using the raw formula only.

{{/*<h2 id="second-chance-age">Second-Chance Age</h2>
<p>The <strong>second-chance age</strong> is the story's revised age
after being re-posted from the the <a

queue</a>.</p>*/}}
